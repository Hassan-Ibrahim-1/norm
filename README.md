### Norm

Small WIP language based on a bytecode VM.

My ultimate goal with this is to be able to write a small game engine in Norm and to learn more about compilers in general. 

### Why?

My primary motivation for Norm was that I really like strong type systems and simplicity in a language. There isn't any scripting/interpreted language that I know of that has these primary goals. I wanted a language that helped me write correct code, but also write it quickly without obsessing over low-level details all the time.
